# Chisel Note Taking

- To expand our knowledge for digital design, it is nice to know more about other methods or techniques like Chisel.
- Note that the notes here could be copy-pasted from books, guides, or other open-source places.
- No copy-right infringement is intended. It is meant for personal learnings only.
- The source from [Chisel Beefy Book](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book) is a really nice book so almost all the explanations and examples come from there.
- The details are in individual markdown texts:

1. [Basic Components](basic_components.md) - best place to start.
2. [Build Process](building.md) - this is where to find how to compile, build, and generate.
3. [Components](components.md) - more detailed components.
4. [Combinational Building Blocks](combi_blocks.md) - more about the fully combinational building blocks like encoders and decoders.
5. [Sequential Building Blocks](seq_blocks.md) - tackle about registers.
6. [Input Processing](input_processing.md) - nice example about debouncers and filtering.
7. [FSM](fsm.md) - classic FSM discussion.
8. [Hardware Generators](hardware_gen.md) - nice techniques for parametrization and functions for generation.
9. [Design Examples](design_examples.md) - small examples for practice.
